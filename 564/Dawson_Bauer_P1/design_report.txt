I decided to choose BST data structure for my final submission. This was partially because it was hinted at 
in the assigment doc, but also because I feel the most comfortable coding these, and I know it would be 
time complexity efficient for the requirements. I did consider using a Self-Balancing BST at one point, but
I got lost in the coding about how to Balance a tree of strings without worsening my time complexity. 

Locate Command:

best case: O(1)
average case: O(log n)
worst case: O(n)

space complexity: O(n)
